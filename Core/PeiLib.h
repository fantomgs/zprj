ScanGuid (

  )
/*++

Routine Description:

  Scans a target buffer for a GUID, and returns a pointer to the matching GUID
  in the target buffer.

  This function searches target the buffer specified by Buffer and Length from
  the lowest address to the highest address at 128-bit increments for the 128-bit
  GUID value that matches Guid.  If a match is found, then a pointer to the matching
  GUID in the target buffer is returned.  If no match is found, then NULL is returned.
  If Length is 0, then NULL is returned.
  If Length > 0 and Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Buffer is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is not aligned on a 128-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (EFI_MAX_ADDRESS ?Buffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 

Arguments:

  Buffer - Pointer to the target buffer to scan.
  Length - Number of bytes in Buffer to scan.
  Guid   - Value to search for in the target buffer.
  
Returns:
  A pointer to the matching Guid in the target buffer or NULL otherwise.
